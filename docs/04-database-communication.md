# Database communication
Serverpod makes it easy to communicate with your database using strictly typed objects without a single SQL line. But, if you need to do more complex tasks, you can always do direct SQL calls. You define your database mappings right in the protocol yaml files.

## Database mappings
It's possible to map serializable classes straight to tables in your database. To do this, add the `table` key to your yaml file:

```yaml
class: Company
table: company
fields:
  name: String
  foundedDate: DateTime?
  employees: List<Employee>
```

When running `serverpod generate`, the database schema will be saved in the `generated/tables.pgsql` file. You can use this to create the corresponding database tables.

In some cases, you want to save a field to the database, but it should never be sent to the server. You can exclude it from the protocol by adding the `database` flag to the type.

```yaml
class: UserData
fields:
  name: String
  password: String, database
```

Likewise, if you only want a field to be accessible in the protocol but not stored in the server, you can add the `api` flag. By default, a field is accessible to both the API and the database.

### Database indexes
For performance reasons, you may want to add indexes to your database tables. You add these in the yaml-files defining the serializable objects.

```yaml
class: Company
table: company
fields:
  name: String
  foundedDate: DateTime?
  employees: List<Employee>
indexes:
  company_name_idx:
    fields: name
```

The `fields` key holds a comma-separated list of column names. In addition, it's possible to add a type key (default is `btree`), and a `unique` key (default is `false`).

## Making queries
For the communication to work, you need to have generated serializable classes with the `table` key set, and the corresponding table must have been created in the database.

### Inserting a table row
Insert a new row in the database by calling the insert method of the `db` field in your `Session` object.

```dart
var myRow = Company(name: 'Serverpod corp.', employees: []);
await Company.insert(session, myRow);
```

After the object has been inserted, it's `id` field is set from its row in the database.

### Finding a single row
You can find a single row, either by its `id` or using an expression. You need to pass a reference to the a session in the call. Tables are accessible through generated serializable classes.

```dart
var myCompany = await Company.findById(session, companyId);
```

If no matching row is found, `null` is returned. You can also search for rows using expressions with the `where` parameter. The `where` parameter is a typed expression builder. The builder's parameter, `t`, contains a description of the table which gives access to the table's columns.

```dart
var myCompany = await Company.findSingleRow(
  session,
  where: (t) => t.name.equals('My Company'),
);
```

### Finding multiple rows
To find multiple rows, use the same principle as for finding a single row. Returned will be a `List` of `TableRow`s.

```dart
var companies = await Company.find(
  tCompany,
  where: (t) => t.id < 100,
  limit 50,
);
```
### Updating a row
To update a row, use the `update` method. The object that you update must have its `id` set to a non `null` value.

```dart
var myCompany = await session.db.findById(tCompany, companyId) as Company?;
myCompany.name = 'New name';
await session.db.update(myCompany);
```

### Deleting rows
Deleting a single row works similarly to the `update` method, but you can also delete rows using the where parameter.

```dart
// Delete a single row
await Company.deleteRow(session, myCompany);

// Delete all rows where the company name ends with 'Ltd'
await Company.delete(
  where: (t) => t.name.like('%Ltd'),
);
```

### Creating expressions
To find or delete specific rows, most often, expressions are needed. Serverpod makes it easy to build expressions that are statically type-checked. Columns are referenced using the global table descriptor objects. The table descriptors, `t` are passed to the expression builder function. The `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `&`, and `|` operators are overridden to make it easier to work with column values. When using the operators, it's a good practice to place them within a set of parentheses as the precedence rules are not always what would be expected. These are some examples of expressions.

```dart
// The name column of the Company table equals 'My company')
t.name.equals('My company')

// Companies founded at or after 2020
t.foundedDate >= DateTime.utc(2020)

// Companies with number of employees between 10 and 100
(t.numEmployees > 10) & (t.numEmployees <= 100)

// Companies that has the founded date set
t.foundedDate.notEquals(null)
```

### Executing raw queries
Sometimes more advanced tasks need to be performed on the database. For those occasions, it's possible to run raw SQL queries on the database. Use the `query` method. A `List<List<dynamic>>` will be returned with rows and columns.

```dart
var result = await session.db.query('SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE ...');
```

### View
View will consider as Table in Serverpod. You can use the same way to query data from view. But you can't insert, update or delete data from view. For now, you need to manually create your view in database and then declare in protocol how we declare the table.

Example you have Company table that have OwnerId as FK on Person Table, now you need one view to show the company name and person name. You can create view in protocol like this:
```yaml
class: CompanyView
table: company_view
asView: true
fields:
  name: String
  ownerName: String
```
The `asView` field when set to true then the generated code will treat this class as view and will not generate insert, update and delete method for this class.

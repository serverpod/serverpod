# This is the configuration file for your staging environment. The staging
# environment is meant to resemble the production environment as much as
# possible and may connect to production databases services and data. You use it
# for final testing before deploying the production server.
#
# Typically, you will want to route the traffic through a load balancer
# which adds SSL security through https. If you use Serverpod's standard
# Terraform scripts to deploy your server, all you need to change in
# this file is the examplepod.com domain name.

// `client.example` on the client side.

// After adding or modifying an endpoint, you will need to run
// `serverpod generate` to update the server and client code.

  // creating a public method with `Session` as its first parameter.
  // `bool`, `int`, `double`, `String`, `UuidValue`, `Duration`, `DateTime`, `ByteData`,
  // and other serializable classes, exceptions and enums from your from your `protocol` directory.
  // The methods should return a typed future; the same types as for the parameters are
  // supported. The `session` object provides access to the database, logging,
  // passwords, and information about the request being made to the server.

## TODOs Requiring New GitHub Issues

### HIGH PRIORITY

#### Issue: Implement localKeys and localSize in RedisCache

**Files**: 
- `packages/serverpod/lib/src/cache/redis_cache.dart:87`
- `packages/serverpod/lib/src/cache/redis_cache.dart:92`

**Description**:
The `RedisCache` class currently throws `UnimplementedError` for the `localKeys` getter and `localSize` getter, which are part of the `GlobalCache` interface. These methods need to be properly implemented to complete the cache interface.

**Context**:
```dart
@override
// TODO: implement localKeys
List<String> get localKeys =>
    throw UnimplementedError('No local keys are used in RedisCache');

@override
// TODO: implement localSize
int get localSize =>
    throw UnimplementedError('No local keys are used in RedisCache');
```

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Research whether Redis-based caches should track local keys or if these methods should return empty/zero values
- Implement the methods according to the intended cache semantics
- Add tests to verify the implementation

**Impact**: API completeness, prevents runtime errors when these methods are called

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Architecture Improvements

#### Issue: Add server cluster support to MessageCentral

**File**: `packages/serverpod/lib/src/server/message_central.dart:16`

**Description**:
The `MessageCentral` class currently only handles communication within a single server instance. It needs to be extended to support communication between servers in a cluster deployment.

**Context**:
```dart
// TODO: Support for server clusters.

/// The [MessageCentral] handles communication within the server, and between
/// servers in a cluster. It is especially useful when working with streaming
/// endpoints.
```

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Design a messaging protocol for cross-server communication
- Implement pub/sub mechanism (possibly Redis-based) for cluster-wide message distribution
- Add configuration options for cluster mode
- Ensure backward compatibility with single-server deployments
- Add comprehensive tests for cluster scenarios

**Impact**: Essential for production deployments with multiple server instances

---

#### Issue: Refactor request handling to use Router from relic package

**File**: `packages/serverpod/lib/src/server/server.dart:190`

**Description**:
The current server implementation uses manual path and HTTP verb dispatch. This should be refactored to use the `Router` class from the `relic` package for better maintainability and extensibility.

**Context**:
```dart
// TODO: Use Router instead of manual dispatch on path and verb
if (uri.path == '/') {
  // Perform health checks
  ...
}
```

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Use the `Router` class from the `relic` package (already a dependency)
- Implement route matching and dispatching logic using relic's Router API
- Migrate existing manual dispatch code to use Router
- Add support for route parameters and pattern matching as provided by relic
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Add tests for route matching edge cases

**Impact**: Code maintainability, extensibility for adding new routes, better error handling

---

#### Issue: Refactor httpResponseHeaders to use Headers class from relic package

**File**: `packages/serverpod/lib/src/server/server.dart:180`

**Description**:
The `httpResponseHeaders` should use the `Headers` class from the `relic` package instead of the current Map implementation for better type safety and API consistency.

**Context**:
```dart
// TODO: Make httpResponseHeaders a Headers object from the get-go.
// or better yet, use middleware
final headers = Headers.build((mh) {
  for (var rh in httpResponseHeaders.entries) {
    mh[rh.key] = ['${rh.value}'];
  }
});
```

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Change `httpResponseHeaders` from `Map<String, String>` to use the `Headers` class from the `relic` package directly
- Refactor code to use the Headers type throughout the codebase
- Update related APIs to work with the new type
- Consider using middleware as suggested in the comment
- Ensure backward compatibility or provide migration guide
- Add tests for header manipulation

**Impact**: Type safety, API consistency, better developer experience

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Feature Enhancements

#### Issue: Add -d/--directory option to serverpod generate command

**File**: `tools/serverpod_cli/lib/src/commands/generate.dart:50`

**Description**:
The `serverpod generate` command should support a `-d` or `--directory` option to allow users to specify which directory to generate code for, rather than always operating on the current directory.

**Context**:
```dart
// TODO: add a -d option to select the directory
GeneratorConfig config;
try {
  config = await GeneratorConfig.load();
```

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Add a `--directory` or `-d` command-line option to the generate command
- Update `GeneratorConfig.load()` to accept an optional directory parameter
- Update command help text and documentation
- Add tests for directory specification
- Handle edge cases (non-existent directories, permission issues, etc.)

**Impact**: Improved CLI usability, especially for monorepo setups or CI/CD pipelines

---

#### Issue: Expand content type mappings in public storage endpoint

**File**: `packages/serverpod/lib/src/cloud_storage/public_endpoint.dart:9`

**Description**:
The public storage endpoint currently has limited content type mappings. More common file types should be added to improve file serving capabilities.

**Context**:
```dart
// TODO: Add more content type mappings.
```

**Current Implementation Analysis Needed**: Review existing mappings and identify gaps

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Audit current content type mappings
- Add mappings for common file types (images, videos, documents, archives, etc.)
- Consider using a standard MIME type library
- Add configuration option for custom mappings
- Add tests for various file types

**Impact**: Better file serving support, fewer content type issues in production

---

#### Issue: Add comparison and additional operations to database column API

**File**: `packages/serverpod/lib/src/database/concepts/columns.dart:62`

**Description**:
The database column API needs additional comparison operators and operations to support more complex queries.

**Context**:
```dart
// TODO: Add comparisons and possibly other operations
```

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Design additional column operations (LIKE, IN, BETWEEN, etc.)
- Implement comparison operators for different data types
- Ensure type-safe query building
- Add comprehensive tests for new operations
- Update documentation with examples

**Impact**: Enhanced query capabilities, better ORM functionality

#### Issue: Remove backwards compatibility code after new auth deployment

**Description**:
Several pieces of backwards compatibility code can be removed once the new authentication system is fully deployed and all users have migrated.

**Affected Files**:
- `packages/serverpod_client/lib/src/serverpod_client_shared.dart:243` - "Remove this backwards compatibility assignment"
- `packages/serverpod_serialization/lib/src/serialization.dart:250` - "Remove this in 2.0.0 as the extensions should be used instead"

**Context**:
The first TODO is about `authenticationKeyManager` backwards compatibility, which should be removed after new auth is deployed.
The second TODO is about serialization fallback, but this should remain as it's an intentional safety feature (not truly a "backwards compatibility" issue).

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Mark `authenticationKeyManager` as deprecated
- Plan removal for next major version after migration period
- Update documentation with migration instructions
- Add warnings for deprecated usage
- Monitor usage before removal

**Impact**: Cleaner API, reduced maintenance burden

---

#### Issue: Template TODOs in library files (Low Priority)

**Description**:
Some library files contain template TODOs that are placeholders and may not need actual implementation.

**Affected Files**:
- `packages/serverpod_service_client/lib/serverpod_service_client.dart:9` - "Export any libraries intended for clients of this package"
- `tests/serverpod_test_shared/lib/src/external_custom_class.dart:1` - "Put public facing types in this file"
- `packages/serverpod/lib/src/database/adapters/postgres/value_encoder.dart:38` - Empty TODO with comment about ByteData detection hack

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Review each file to determine if exports/types are actually needed
- Either implement the suggested additions or remove the TODO if not applicable
- For value_encoder.dart, either improve the ByteData detection or document why current approach is necessary

**Impact**: Code cleanliness, reduced confusion

---

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Create GitHub issues for HIGH priority items (RedisCache methods)
2. **Phase 2**: Create GitHub issues for MEDIUM priority Architecture items (cluster support, router, headers)
3. **Phase 3**: Create GitHub issues for MEDIUM priority Features (CLI options, content types, DB operations)
4. **Phase 4**: Create consolidated GitHub issues for LOW priority items (logging, clarifications, type coverage, SQL parsing, CLI refactoring)
5. **Phase 5**: Track AUTH-related TODOs in a single epic issue, to be addressed after new auth system deployment

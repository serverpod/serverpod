class: RefreshToken
serverOnly: true
table: serverpod_auth_jwt_refresh_token
fields:
  id: UuidValue?, defaultPersist=random

  ### The [AuthUser] this profile belongs to.
  authUser: module:auth_user:AuthUser?, relation(onDelete=Cascade)

  ### The scopes given to this session.
  ###
  ### These will also be added to each access token as a claim named "scopeNames".
  scopeNames: Set<String>

  ### Extra claims to be added to each access token created for this refresh token.
  ###
  ### This is a `Map<String, dynamic>` where each entry uses the key as the claim name.
  ### The value must be convertible to JSON.
  ###
  ### Users must ensure that the claims don't conflict with [registerd claims](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1)
  ### or the above mentioned claim "scopeNames".
  ###
  ### This is only stored as a serialized String in the database due to schema limitations.
  extraClaims: String?

  ### The fixed part of the secret.
  ###
  ### Any incoming rotation request referencing refresh token by ID and having the correct fixed part,
  ### but not the correct `secret`, will cause the refresh token to be invalidated (as the refresh token
  ### may have been leaked at that point).
  ### The the pure `id` is also part of the JWT access token for reference, we have to have this second
  ### part in here, ensuring that no-one with just a captured JWT can invalidate the refresh token.
  ###
  ### Per default uses 16 bytes of random data.
  fixedSecret: ByteData

  ### The most recent rotating secret associated with this refresh token.
  ###
  ### This is changed on every rotation of the refresh token,
  ### whenever a new access token is created.
  ###
  ### Per default uses 64 bytes of random data, and its hash is stored peppered and salted.
  rotatingSecretHash: ByteData

  ### The salt used for comuting the [rotatingSecretHash].
  ###
  ### Per default uses 16 bytes of random data.
  rotatingSecretSalt: ByteData

  ### The time when the [rotatingSecretHash] / [rotatingSecretSalt] pair was last updated.
  lastUpdated: DateTime, default=now

  ### The time when the first refresh token was created.
  created: DateTime, default=now

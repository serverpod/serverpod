### Providers of user identity, each maped to a folder within the
### `lib/src/providers` directory. This class is used by the
### `IdpEndpoint.idpAccounts` method, which allows developers to determine which
### identity providers a user has already linked to their account.
###
### If developers include their own custom Idps, they should consider creating
### an entirely new enum with values for all of the providers they use,
### including any custom ones, and mimic the `IdpEndpoint.idpAccounts` method
### to return values from that new enum.
enum: IdentityProvider
serialized: byName
values:
  - anonymous
  - apple
  - email
  - firebase
  - google
  - passkey

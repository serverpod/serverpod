foregoing rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees.

into any of the Projects. The decision to use or incorporate your Contributions into any of the Projects will be

that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction
to be unenforceable, the remaining portions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.

# Authentication example
This example demonstrates a minimal app with authentication with email and Google. Note that additional setup steps are required for the Google authentication to work. For more information, see the [documentation](https://docs.serverpod.dev/concepts/authentication).

Other methods of authentication work in very similar ways to Sign in with Google, but usually require less setup.

interrupted account creation (e.g. mail verified, but 2FA setup not done)
-> When to do the account creation?

require "password reset" when 2FA is required but not setup during registration? (re-verifying email access)

lifecycle hooks, e.g. send out e-mail after user account is fully activated

hook: send SMS (from 2FA account) when password reset is requested

invite as a token to register as a pre-defined user
invite link: can we ensure the user opened it from an email?


limit sign up via invites and certain mail domains?


hook to merge users post registration, before user creation


invite "registration" seems like "adding a second login provider" to the current account



tenant
-> hook to get for example extended user info for tenant (each user could have multiple)
-> not a core goal

should any default APIs return `UserInfo`?
For the custom user info, it might be that the server only wants those to be used internally (e.g managing permissions), so they should not be exposed r/w by any service by default (or returned as part of the registration etc.)

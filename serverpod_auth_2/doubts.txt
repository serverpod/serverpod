maybe we've been slicing it all wrong

maybe a "provider module" should not expose their own endpoints and then do some hook-ups behind the scenes,
but rather a module should provide some core functionality (like e-mail sign-up / verification),
and if the developer wants to support (a certain) 2FA they just wrap it up in their own APIs

This would also make the flows much clearer, and eg. you could see "always require 2FA" in e-mail but never to so in Passkey, instead of having it implicitly look at "additional data" and ignore requests sometimesâ€¦

  // TODO: Maybe this would need to be extended into 2 APIs, so app's could show some info "about the invitation"

/// We could image 3 approaches outright:
///  - Invitation code (either static, or DB-counted with a limit), allowing "closed" registrations so that no public endpoints can be used (if the providers check this)
///  - A "token based" approached, that returns a signed information with some user info to use post-registration (this could be tricky to ensure that it's only used once (or n times), but some systems might want this)
///  - An invitation code that refers to a previously created user which does not yet have an authentication-mechanism ("login") assigned to it
///    - The drawback of this approach would of course be, that if the user already has an account and you just want to invite them to a certain work team, for example, then they could not accept this with their existing account, but rather would have to create a new one (hoping that they still have another authentication mechanism available)
///    - So developer should probably beforehand check if the user does not exist already, and allow looking them up
///      - Would this be even trickier in a multi-tenant way? Where the user account might exist, but the user (from another tenant) should not be able to see it?

// TODO: In order to solve the last point above (that the invited user might already have an account), we might need to use a "deferred user creation" by default

/// Demo implementation of what an invitation flow could look like which creates a new user
///
/// This user can then already be used in the app (e.g. assigned to a team),
/// and the link to an authentication will be done when one is registered with the return code.

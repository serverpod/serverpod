    # Since this is a library monorepo, it is important that the same package is updated
    # in all directories at the same time.
    # Currently dependabot does not support this type of grouping, therefore the number
    # of open pull requests is limited to 1. This prevents multiple pull requests
    # from being opened for the same dependency.

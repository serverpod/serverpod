///
/// Implementations can handle [DiagnosticEvent] instances of a specific
/// type or context, or all events.
///
/// ## Guidelines
///
/// A [DiagnosticEvent] represents an event that occurs in the server.
/// [DiagnosticEventHandler] implementations can react to these events
/// in order to gain insights into the behavior of the server.
///
/// As the name suggests the handlers should perform diagnostics only,
/// and not have any responsibilities that the regular functioning
/// of the server depends on.
///
/// The registered handlers are typically run concurrently,
/// can not depend on each other, and asynchronously -
/// they are not awaited by the operation they are triggered from.
///
/// If a handler throws an exception it will be logged to stderr
/// and otherwise ignored.
///
/// ## Time limits
///
/// Handlers should not run for an extended period of time.
/// Permitting that would risk accumulating resource consumption
/// and make the long-running performance of the server degrade.
/// This is especially true in situations of high load
/// or implementation issues causing a large number of events.
///
/// By default they are given a maximum of 30 seconds to complete.
/// This can be overridden by setting the diagnostic handler timeout
/// in the constructor of the [Serverpod] instance.
/// {@endtemplate}

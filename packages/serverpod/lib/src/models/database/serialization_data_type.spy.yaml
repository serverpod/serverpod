### Serialization types for `ColumnSerializable` columns.
### The `json` and `jsonb` data types accept almost identical sets of values as input.
### The major practical difference is one of efficiency.
### See: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html
enum: SerializationDataType
serialized: byName
values:
  ### The `json` data type stores an exact copy of the input text,
  ### which processing functions must reparse on each execution
  - json

  ### The `jsonb` data is stored in a decomposed binary format
  ### that makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead,
  ### but significantly faster to process, since no reparsing is needed.
  ### `jsonb` also supports indexing, which can be a significant advantage.
  - jsonb
